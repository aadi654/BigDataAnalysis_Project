## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The project explores a global e-commerce dataset and applies data science techniques to extract insights and build predictive models. Key tasks include:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and customer clustering  
- Predictive modelling using regression and ensemble methods  
- Model evaluation and refinement  
- Visualizations for insights and reporting  

The implementation is contained in a single Jupyter Notebook:  
**`BigDataProject_final.ipynb`**
